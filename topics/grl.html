              <p class="card-text"  style="font-size: 14px;">The increasing popularity of online food blogs and 
                food ordering services has made personalized recipe recom- mendation a vital aspect of our 
                emotional well-being. However, existing solutions, mainly based on graph neural networks, 
                still face significant challenges, such as (a) focusing on exploiting the user-recipe 
                interactions while neglecting other crucial pair- wise and high-order relationships, and 
                (b) failing to explicitly distinguish the distinct factors, e.g., hedonic and healthy, that 
                influence recipe selection. To address these issues, we propose a 
                progressively-passing-then-disentangling approach named P2D. Our approach utilizes a three-stage 
                progressive message-passing mechanism for better representation learning. Specifically, we 
                incorporate the extra pairwise relationships between recipes and nutrients, ingredients, and 
                visual contents to create fine-grained and multimodal recipe representations. We next refine 
                these representations via message passing between high-order recipe relationships to learn peopleâ€™s 
                shared food preferences. Based on them, we could derive comprehensive user representations, which 
                are subsequently transformed into disentangled forms that correspond to various decision factors 
                through contrastive and mutual information regularization. Experimental results demon- strate both 
                the superiority and the rationality of our method: (a) P2D outperforms the state-of-the-art recipe 
                recommendation methods by a large margin under various metrics, (b) ablation studies confirm the 
                positive impact of each of its components, and (c) our visualization analysis empirically supports 
                the advantage of explicitly disentangling decision factors.</p>

              <p class="card-text"  style="font-size: 14px;">Understanding human mobility patterns at the point-of-interest (POI) scale plays 
                an important role in enhancing business intelligence in mobile environments.
                While large efforts have been made in this direction, most studies simply utilize POI check-ins to mine the concerned mobility patterns, 
                the effectiveness of which is usually hindered due to data sparsity. 
                To obtain better POI-based human mobility for mining, in this paper, we strive to directly annotate the POIs associated with 
                raw user-generated mobility records. 
                We propose a neural context fusion approach which integrates various context factors in people's POI-visiting behaviors. 
                Our approach evaluates the preference and transition factors via representation learning. 
                Notably, we incorporate an attention mechanism to deal with the randomized transitions in raw mobility. 
                The domain knowledge factors, i.e., distance, time and popularity, remain effective and our approach further includes them from a data-driven perspective. 
                Factors are automatically fused with a feed-forward neural network. 
                Furthermore, we exploit a multi-head architecture to enhance the model expressiveness. 
                Using two real-life data sets, we conduct our experimental study and find that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art 
                baselines by at least 32 percent in accuracy. 
                Besides, we demonstrate the utility of the obtained POI-based human mobility with a POI recommendation example.</p>

              <p class="card-text"  style="font-size: 14px;">
                Network anomaly detection has become very popular in recent years 
                because of the importance of discovering key
                regions of structural inconsistency in the network. In addition
                to application-specific information carried by anomalies, the
                presence of such structural inconsistency is often an impediment
                to the effective application of data mining algorithms such as
                community detection and classification. In this paper, we study
                the problem of detecting structurally inconsistent nodes that
                connect to a number of diverse influential communities in large
                social networks. We show that the use of a network embedding
                approach, together with a novel dimension reduction technique,
                is an effective tool to discover such structural inconsistencies. We
                also experimentally show that the detection of such anomalous
                nodes has significant applications: one is the specific use of
                detected anomalies, and the other is the improvement of the
                effectiveness of community detection.</p>
